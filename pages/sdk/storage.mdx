# Storage SDK

The Spheron Storage SDK is equipped with multi-chain storage capabilities powered by Spheron.

<Callout type="warning">
  The package is only meant for Node.js environments and will not work in a
  browser or frontend apps.
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/storage
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/storage
```

## Usage

To use the Spheron Storage SDK, you have to create an instance of `SpheronClient`.

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

const client = new SpheronClient({ token });
```

The `SpheronClient` constructor takes an object that has one property `token`.
Follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to generate this token.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** When you are creating the tokens, please choose **web app** type in
  the dashboard.
</Callout>

## Available Methods

The `SpheronClient` instance provides several methods for working with buckets. Here's the list of all the supported methods.

### Upload

Used to upload a file/directory to the specified protocol.

```js
let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await client.upload(
  filePath,
  {
    protocol: ProtocolEnum.IPFS,
    name,
    onUploadInitiated: (uploadId) => {
      console.log(`Upload with id ${uploadId} started...`);
    },
    onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
      currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
      console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
    },
  }
);
```

Function `upload` takes two parameters:

- **filePath** - (string) - The path to the file/directory that will be uploaded.
- **configuration:** An object with the following parameters:
  1.  `configuration.name`
      - Represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data.
  2.  `configuration.protocol`
      - The protocol on which the data will be uploaded. The supported protocols are [ `ARWEAVE`, `IPFS`, `FILECOIN`].
  3.  `configuration.onUploadInitiated` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadId: string) => void`. The function will be called once, when the upload is initiated, right before the data is uploaded. The function will be called with one parameter, `uploadId`, which represents the id of the started upload.
  4.  `configuration.onChunkUploaded` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. The first one `uploadedSize` represents, the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string;
  dynamicLinks: Domain[];
  cid: string;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The CID property will only have value for IPFS and Filecoin uploads.
</Callout>

---

### Encrypt Upload

Used to encrypt a string or a file and upload it to IPFS.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Both the `encryptUpload` functions require an instance of
  LitNodeClient that is already connected. To create an instance, checkout the
  [@lit-protocol/lit-node-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/lit-node-client)
  package or our
  [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/storage-encryption/src/encrypt.js)
</Callout>

```js
const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } =
  await spheron.encryptUpload({
    authSig,
    accessControlConditions,
    chain,
    filePath,
    litNodeClient: client,
    configuration: {
      name: bucketName,
    },
  });
```

Parameters of `encryptUpload`:

- **authSig** - (optional) The authSig of the user. You can use [siwe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/siwe) to create it. Checkout the [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/storage-encryption/src/utils.js).
- **sessionSigs:** - (optional) the session signatures to use to authorize the user with the nodes.
- **accessControlConditions** - (optional) The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token. This could be possession of an NFT, for example.
- **evmContractConditions** - (optional) EVM Smart Contract access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token. This could be possession of an NFT, for example. This is different than accessControlConditions because accessControlConditions only supports a limited number of contract calls. evmContractConditions supports any contract call.
- **solRpcConditions** - (optional) Solana RPC call conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token. This could be possession of an NFT, for example.
- **unifiedAccessControlConditions** - (optional) An array of unified access control conditions. You may use `AccessControlCondition`, `EVMContractCondition`, or `SolRpcCondition` objects in this array, but make sure you add a conditionType for each one.
  <Callout type="info">
    **NOTE:** The function requires either `accessControlConditions`,
    `evmContractConditions`, `solRpcConditions` or
    `unifiedAccessControlConditions`.
  </Callout>
- **chain** - The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.
- **string** - (optional) The string you wish to encrypt.
- **filePath** - (optional) The path to the file you wish to encrypt.

  <Callout type="info">
    **NOTE:** The function requires either `string` of `filePath` parameter to
    be passed.
  </Callout>

- **litNodeClient** - An instance of LitNodeClient that is already connected.
- **configuration**:
  - **name** - Represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data.
  - **onUploadInitiated** - (optional) Callback function `(uploadId: string) => void`. The function will be called once when the upload is initiated, right before the data is uploaded. The function will be called with one parameter, `uploadId`, which represents the id of the started upload.
  - **onChunkUploaded** - (optional) Callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. the first `uploadedSize` represents the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string;
  dynamicLinks: Domain[];
  cid: string;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Checkout the
  [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/storage-encryption/src/encrypt.js)
  on how to use the `encryptUpload` function.
</Callout>

### Decrypt Upload

Used to decrypt the data of the previously encrypted upload.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Both the `decryptUpload` functions require an instance of

- **subdomain**: you should create a **CNAME** type record with the value `cname.spheron.io` and the same name as the domain you have added.
- **handshake-domain**: you should create a **A** type record with the value `ipfs.namebase.io` and `@` for name. Also, you should create a **TXT** type record with the `link` for a value and `_contenthash` for a name.
- **handshake-subdomain**: you should create a **A** type record with the value `ipfs.namebase.io` and the same name as the domain you have added. Also, you should create a **TXT** type record with the `link` for a value and `_contenthash.<name_of_the_domain>` for a name.
- **ens-domain**: you should create a **CONTENT** type record with the `link` for a value and the same name as the domain you have added.

## Storage Utility

### Transforming CID from V0 to V1 and vice versa

The package also provides a couple of methods for transforming CID from V0 to V1 and vice verse.

```js
import { ipfs } from "@spheron/storage";

const cid = <CID_VALUE>;

const v1 = ipfs.utils.toV1(cid);
console.log("CID V1", v1);

const v0 = ipfs.utils.toV0(cid);
console.log("CID V0", v0);
```
