# Fizz Node FAQ

#### 1. Is Docker installation mandatory before installing a Fizz Node?
No, it's not mandatory. The Fizz Node installation script handles Docker installation for you. However, if you already have Docker installed, please ensure it is updated to the latest version.

#### 2. How do I know if my Fizz Node is active?
To check if your Fizz Node is active, visit [Fizz Node Status](https://fizz.spheron.network/). If it shows as active, your node is running. If not, please reach out to our Discord community for assistance.

#### 3. How much can I earn, or is there a token allocated to Fizz Node Runners?
Spheron aims to maximize your earnings by creating a resource pool of idle resources. However, your earnings depend on various factors, including demand. In addition to direct utilization points, Spheron offers IDLE rewards in Fizz Node Points. The network requires a token to operate, and any related information will be communicated publicly.

#### 4. Can I run a Fizz Node on a Windows device?
Support for Windows is currently unavailable, but you can run it on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

#### 5. When installing Docker, I'm receiving an "Incompatible CPU Detected" error on my M1/M2/M3 Mac. What should I do?

This error occurs because Homebrew installs the `amd64` (Intel) version of Docker, which isn't compatible with Apple Silicon (`arm64`) chips like M1, M2, and M3. To resolve this issue, you need to install the Docker version designed for Apple Silicon manually:

1. **Download the Correct Docker Version**:
   - Visit the [Docker Desktop for Mac (Apple Silicon)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) page.
   - Click on **"Download for Mac with Apple Chip"** to get the compatible installer.

2. **Install Docker Manually**:
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
   - Drag and drop the Docker icon into the **Applications** folder.
   - Launch Docker from the **Applications** folder.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Run `docker --version` to ensure Docker is installed correctly and the error is resolved.

Installing Docker directly from the official website ensures compatibility with your Apple Silicon device and eliminates the "Incompatible CPU Detected" error. After you've installed Docker on your Mac and verified it's working, re-run the Fizz Node installation script. This time, it should work for you without any hiccups.

#### 6. Can I run multiple Fizz Nodes on a single device?

No, you can only run one Fizz Node per device. Each Fizz Node is designed to operate independently on a single machine. Additionally, each Fizz Node is mapped to a single wallet address, and you cannot use the same address for multiple Fizz Nodes. This limitation is in place for several reasons:

1. **Resource Management**: Running multiple nodes on a single device could lead to resource conflicts and performance issues.
2. **Fairness**: Limiting to one node per device helps maintain a fair distribution of nodes across the network.
3. **Security**: Mapping each node to a unique wallet address enhances the security and accountability of the network.

If you want to run additional Fizz Nodes, you'll need to use separate devices, each with its own unique wallet address.

#### 7. I have two or more GPUs in my device. Can I run the node to add them all?

This limitation is due to the Fizz Node Software's current design, which is optimized for single-GPU setups. However, the Spheron team is actively working on enhancing this capability.

Future updates aim to allow Fizz Nodes to utilize multiple GPUs simultaneously, which will enable users with multi-GPU setups to contribute more computational power to the network. This improvement will maximize the potential of high-performance systems and provide more flexibility for node operators.

Stay tuned for announcements from the Spheron team regarding updates that will enable multi-GPU support in Fizz Nodes.

#### 8. I'm getting a permission denied error when running the fizzup.sh script. How do I fix this?

If you encounter a "permission denied" error when running the `fizzup.sh` script, it's likely because the script is trying to access `/root/.spheron`, which your current user doesn't have permission to access. This error might look something like this:

![Permission Denied Error](assets/permission-denied-error.png)

To resolve this issue, you need to switch to the root user before executing the script. Follow these steps:

1. Switch to the root user:
   ```bash
   sudo bash
   ```

2. Once you're in the root shell, run the fizzup.sh script:
   ```bash
   ./fizzup.sh
   ```

This should allow the script to access the necessary directories and complete the installation process. Remember to exercise caution when operating as the root user, as it has unrestricted access to your system.


#### 9. Is my data secure using someone else's GPU through a Fizz Node?

When you use a Fizz Node, your data is processed on another user's GPU system. At present, there is no way to prevent a technically savvy GPU owner from accessing your data. We advise against using private or sensitive data on Fizz Nodes. If you need to work with sensitive information, consider using the **Provider** mode to deploy on data center-grade GPUs with enhanced security measures.

Alternatively, you can implement a system where a proxy server handles your data manipulation and storage. You can send data to the service running on the Fizz Node at runtime using secure connections or encryption for tasks like training or fine-tuning. After processing, the results can be retunred to your proxy server for further handling and secure storage. This approach makes accessing your data more difficult for the Fizz Node runner during runtime.

#### 10. How do I check the status of my Fizz Node?

To check the status of your Fizz Node, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Fizz Node Dashboard**:
   - Go to the Fizz Node dashboard by navigating to the URL provided in the setup process.
   - If you're using the Spheron Fizz App, click the "Check Status" button.
   - Alternatively, you can use the command `docker compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml ps` or `docker-compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml ps` to check the status of your Fizz Node.

2. **Review the Status Information**:
   - The status information will be displayed in the output.
   - Look for the container status, which should indicate if the container is running (`Up`) or not (`Exited`).

3. **Check the Logs**:
   - If the container is not running, you can check the logs for any errors or issues by using the command `docker compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml logs` or `docker-compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml logs`.

4. **Verify the Node Status**:
   - If the container is running, your Fizz Node is active.
   - If the container is not running, you can start it again using the command `<your-fizz-node-directory>/fizzup.sh`.

By following these steps, you can verify the status of your Fizz Node and troubleshoot any issues if the container is not running.

#### 11. How do I check the reward details of my Fizz Node?

To check the reward details of your Fizz Node, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Fizz Node Dashboard**:
   - Go to the Fizz Node dashboard by navigating to the URL provided in the setup process.

2. **Review the Reward Details**:
   - The Fizz Node dashboard will display the reward details in FN points.

By following these steps, you can check the reward details of your Fizz Node.

#### 12. When I ran the Fizz Node script, I got an error saying "brew command not found". How do I fix this?

If you encounter an error stating that the "brew command not found" when running the Fizz Node script, it means that Homebrew is not installed on your system or is not properly configured in your PATH. Homebrew is a package management system for macOS on which the Fizz Node script relies. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Install Homebrew**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Homebrew:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

   This command downloads and runs the Homebrew installation script.

2. **Set up the PATH to Homebrew**:
   After installation, you need to ensure that Homebrew is in your system's PATH. Run this command to add Homebrew to your PATH:

   ```bash
   echo 'PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   This command appends the Homebrew binary path to your bash profile.

3. **Reload your bash profile**:
   To apply the changes immediately, run:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

4. **Verify Homebrew installation**:
   Test if Homebrew is working correctly by running:

   ```bash
   brew help
   ```

   If Homebrew is properly installed and configured, you should see the help output for Homebrew commands.

5. **Run the Fizz Node script again**:
   If the brew command is now working properly, you can run the Fizz Node script again:

   ```bash
   ./fizzup.sh
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "brew command not found" error and successfully run the Fizz Node script. If you continue to experience issues, ensure that your system meets all the prerequisites for running a Fizz Node and consider reaching out to the Spheron support community for further assistance.
