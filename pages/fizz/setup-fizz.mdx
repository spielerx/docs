# Setup Fizz Node

Setting up a Fizz node allows you to participate in the Spheron network and earn points by providing computational resources. This guide will walk you through the process of registering and setting up your Fizz node.

## Registration Process

To begin, you must register your Fizz node on the Spheron network. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [fizz.spheron.network](https://fizz.spheron.network) in your web browser.

<Callout type="info">
  **Available only on Testnet:** 
  - Claim some ETH token tokens from our [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.spheron.network).
  - Bridging the token from Arbitrum Sepolia to Spheron Testnet from our [Spheron Bridge](https://spheron-devnet-eth.bridge.caldera.xyz/)
</Callout>

2. Look for and click on the "Register a Fizz Node" button to start the registration process.
3. You'll be presented with a registration form. Fill it out carefully with the following information:

   - **Operating System**: Select your node's OS from the options provided (MacOS, Linux, or Windows).
   - **Node Type**: Specify whether you're setting up a GPU node or a CPU node. This determines the type of computational resources you'll be providing.
   - **GPU Model** (if applicable): If you selected GPU node, choose the specific GPU model you're using.
   - **Resource Details**: Provide accurate information about the resources you're willing to lend, including:
     - CPU cores
     - RAM capacity
     - Available storage

      </Callout>
   - **Region**: Select the geographical location where your node is situated. This helps users choose nodes based on their proximity requirements.
   - **Payment Tokens**: Choose the cryptocurrencies or tokens you will accept as payment for your services.
   - **Gateway Selection**: This is a crucial step. Choose a gateway carefully, considering factors such as:
     - Number of fizz node connected with the gateway. A gateway can't connect more than 1000 fizz node so select another gateway which is nearest to you.
     - Proximity to the gateway, make sure you choose the gateway which is nearest to you so that the latency is not too high for users who want to use your GPU / compute.
     - Try to select the recommended gateway in the list as the dashboard already select the gateway based on your node preferences.

4. To complete the registration, you'll need some ETH on the Spheron chain for gas fees. If you don't have any, you can get some from our faucet at [faucet.spheron.network](https://faucet.spheron.network).

5. (Optional) If the Spheron faucet is not working, you can obtain ETH from Arbitrum Sepolia and bridge it to the Spheron chain:

   a. Get Arbitrum Sepolia ETH from one of these faucets:
      - [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia)
      - [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/arbitrum-sepolia)
      - [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia)
      - [LearnWeb3 Faucet](https://learnweb3.io/faucets/arbitrum_sepolia/)

   b. Once you have ETH on Arbitrum Sepolia, use the [Spheron Bridge](https://spheron-devnet-eth.bridge.caldera.xyz/) to transfer ETH to the Spheron chain.

   c. After bridging, check your balance on the Spheron chain to ensure the transfer was successful.

<Callout type="info">
This step is only necessary if you could not get ETH from the Spheron faucet. You can skip this step if you successfully obtained ETH from the Spheron faucet.
</Callout>

6. Now click on the "Register" button. 

7. Once you confirm the transaction, your node will be officially registered in the Spheron network, and you can proceed to the next steps.

## Learn About Your System Specs / Resources

### Mac Users: How to Check Your System Configuration

Before we start, you need to open something called the Terminal. It's like a special notepad where you can type commands to talk to your computer. Here's how to find it:

1. Look for a magnifying glass icon at the top right of your screen. That's called Spotlight.
2. Click on it or simultaneously press the Command (âŒ˜) key and Space bar.
3. Type "Terminal" and press Enter.
4. A white or black window will open. That's the Terminal!

Now that you have the Terminal open, you can type these magic words (we call them commands) to learn about your computer:

- **Check Storage Type:**
   ```
   system_profiler SPStorageDataType
   ```

- **Check Hardware Specifications:**
   ```
   system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
   ```

- **Check GPU Type:**
   ```
   system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
   ```


### Linux Users: How to Check Your System Configuration

To use these commands:
1. Click inside the Terminal window.
2. Type or copy-paste one of the commands above.
3. Press the Enter key.
4. The computer will show you some information. That's what we're looking for!

- **Check Storage Information:**
   ```
   df -h
   ```

- **Get Detailed Hardware Information:**
   ```
   sudo lshw
   ```

- **List CPU Information:**
   ```
   sudo lshw -class processor
   ```

- **List Memory Details:**
   ```
   sudo lshw -class memory
   ```

## Running the Fizz Node Client

After successfully registering your node, you need to set up and run the Fizz node client on your machine. This client software connects your node to the Spheron network and manages resource allocation. Follow these steps:

1. Access the setup page for your registered node. There, You should find a link to download the `fizzup.sh` script.
2. Download the `fizzup.sh` script to your machine. Make sure to save it in a location you can easily access via a terminal or command prompt.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
4. Make the script executable by running the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x <location of fizzup script>/fizzup.sh
   ```
   Replace `<location of fizzup script>` with the actual path to the script's directory.
5. Run the script by entering the following command:
   ```bash
   <location of fizzup script>/fizzup.sh
   ```
   This command executes the script and starts the Fizz node client on your machine.
6. To verify if your Fizz node is running, use the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml logs -f
   ```
   If this doesn't work, try:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml logs -f
   ```
   These commands will show you the logs of your Fizz node, allowing you to confirm it's running correctly.
7. Once you've verified the node is running, return to the setup page on the Spheron Fizz App.
8. On the setup page, you'll see a "Check Status" button and a switch to "Automatically check status."
9. Click the "Check Status" button to manually initiate a status check for your Fizz node.
10. Alternatively, you can toggle on the "Automatically check status" switch to have the system periodically check your node's status without manual intervention.
11. The system will now perform checks to validate if your node is active and correctly configured.

<Callout type="info">
  The validation process may take a few minutes. During this time, the system verifies your node's connectivity, resource availability, and configuration.
</Callout>

12. Once your node is confirmed active, you will be automatically directed to your Fizz dashboard.

## Accessing Your Dashboard

After your node has been successfully validated and marked active, you'll be redirected to the main Fizz node dashboard. This dashboard is your control center for managing your node and tracking your earnings. Here's what you can expect:

- **Node Status**: Real-time information about your node's activity and health.
- **Resource Utilization**: Graphs and statistics show how your node's resources are used.
- **Earnings Tracker**: A detailed breakdown of your points and earnings from providing resources to the network.
- **Settings and Configuration**: Options to adjust your node's resource settings or modify available resources.

Check your dashboard regularly to ensure your node performs optimally and stay informed about your earnings in the Spheron network.

<Callout type="warning">
Remember to keep your node running and maintain a stable internet connection to maximize your deployment opportunities and earnings.
