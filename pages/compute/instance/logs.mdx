# Logs & Activity

## Logs

You can find the following three types of logs on the instance page:

1. Instance Logs
2. Instance Events
3. Deploy Logs

### Instance Logs

Instance logs are generated by the instance itself. They can be useful for troubleshooting and debugging issues within the instance and the applications running on it.

### Instance Events

Instance events provide information on events related to the instance, such as when it was started or stopped,
when changes were made to its configuration, and when upgrades or maintenance were performed.
Instance events can be useful for tracking the history of an instance and understanding how it has been used over time.

### Deploy Logs

Deploy logs generated during the container deployment or updates to the container running on the instance.
Deploy logs can be useful for tracking the progress of a deployment, identifying errors or issues that may have occurred during
the deployment, and verifying that the deployment was successful.

## Activity

Activity provides all the updates that happen in between deployments. 
The deployment occurs only once, and these updates are only generated when settings are modified.
This includes updates on the status of a deployment, such as whether it is successful, failed, or is currently in progress.
