  **Troubleshoot:**
  - ***For All Networks except Solana:*** If your transaction fails,
  check if the Spheron escrow wallet has enough balance. To deposit more funds,
  go through the **Deposit Funds** section.
  - ***For Solana:*** If your transaction fails
  and the amounts get deducted, you can click "Already Paid?" in the transaction
  section. You can then enter the transaction hash, and if it is verified, your
  transaction will succeed.

## Bonus Lifecycle

### For All Networks except Solana
You cannot remove an active bonus. However, you can stop its automatic renewal from the next month.

To stop the automatic renewal of your bonus:
1. Go to the **[Bonus](https://app.spheron.network/#/app/billing/plan)** section under the **Billing** tab.
2. Click the delete icon beside the bonus you want to remove.
3. From the modal, Click "Remove" to stop its renewal.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** You can still use the current month's bonus after you stop its renewal.
</Callout>

### For Solana
You cannot remove an active bonus. All payments are made upfront. So there is no auto-renewal in this case.
