# Handshake Domains

[Handshake](https://handshake.org/) is a decentralized, permissionless naming protocol where every peer validates and manages the root DNS naming zone to create an alternative to existing Certificate Authorities and naming systems.

In essence, Handshake takes a core piece of the internet infrastructure, DNS's root zone file, and puts it on a blockchain. At a high level, Handshake is just a decentralized DNS, but solving the CA problem and making it possible to self-custody, use, and transfer names permissionless in a publicly-verifiable way opens up exciting applications for developers that weren't feasible before Handshake.

  **NOTE:** \
  We are using [Namebase](https://www.namebase.io/) to interact with Handshake Domains. Namebase is an NFT name registrar that operates on the Handshake blockchain. Namebase makes it easy to get your own NFT username on Handshake. You can use your Handshake name for secure login, decentralized websites, and top-level domain names.
