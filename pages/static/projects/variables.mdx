# Environment variables
Spheron allows you to add environment variables in the **Advanced Build Settings** section while configuring your deployment for the first time. If your project already exists, you can go to the **Environment variables** section in the sidebar of your project's settings. 

Spheron lets you assign different environment variables to different environments based on your requirements. To configure these variables:
1. Go to the Settings tab of your project.
2. Select **Environment variables** from the sidebar.
3. Add variable name and variable value, and select your preferred deployment environments. Then Click "Add."
4. You can also add **multiple environment variables** by uploading them in a prescribed JSON file format.

  **NOTE:** After adding the environment variables, you need to redeploy the project to apply it.
</Callout>

## Prescribed JSON format
```json
{
	"name": "Key5", // name of the key
	"value": "B", // value of env variable
	"environments": ["Development"] // environments you need to attach to the variable
},
{
	"name": "Key8",
	"value": "a"
},
{
	"name": "Key5",
	"value": "test",
	"environments": ["Production"]
},
{
	"name": "Key10",
	"value": "base",
	"environments": ["Production", "Development"]
