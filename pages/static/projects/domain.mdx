# Domains Configuration

By default, Spheron provides a subdomain when a project is deployed.
E.g., subdomain.spheron.app
You can point your domain either to an environment or a particular deployment from an environment.

## Attach a Domain

Follow these steps to configure your domain:

1. Select your project.
2. Go to the **Configure your Domains** section under the **Domains** tab.
3. Enter your Domain name.
4. Select **Environments** if you want to point your domain to environments.
5. Or, Select a **Deployment** if you want to point your domain to a particular deployment.
6. Click "Add."
7. Add the records shown in the platform to your DNS provider and wait for the domain records to propagate.
8. Click "Verify" after a few minutes. Your domain will connect to the deployment.
