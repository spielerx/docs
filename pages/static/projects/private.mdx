# Password Protected Domains

Spheron allows you to make your domains private. Password protection provides an added layer of security to your website. Activating password protection will require visitors to enter a password to access your website. Once they provide valid credentials, they will be allowed to access your site. You can also launch an invite-only platform requiring users to enter a password to gain access.

## Activate Password Protection

To activate password protection:
1. Go to the Settings tab of your project.
2. Select **Security** from the sidebar.
3. Click "Add Password Protection."
4. Add a secure password and Click "Continue."

  **NOTE:** You need to redeploy the project once you enable password protection.
