# How to Deploy Vue Apps in less than 30 Seconds

This guide will show you how to deploy a Vue.js project and set up your domain.
[Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition.

## Deploy Vue.js to Spheron

Follow these steps to deploy your first Vue.js app on Spheron successfully.

### Step 1: Put Your Vue.js Project Code in a Git Repo

While this feature is not new to developers, the magic of Spheron is that every push to any branch in your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo triggers a new build and deployment of your project.

### Step 2: Deploy using the Spheron Platform UI.

You can create a new Spheron project using the platform UI. First, visit [Spheron Network](https://app.spheron.network/) in your browser.
Choose your preferred Git provider from the options and authorize Spheron to access the repo you want to deploy.
In the next screen, select your Vue.js repo from the list.
Choose your preferred protocol where you want to deploy your static build. As of now, we support Arweave, Skynet, Filecoin & Pinata. You can choose any one protocol from all 4 of them.
The third screen asks for details about where to create the project and how to build it. All the settings are already pre-filled based on the suggested framework. Learn more about each build setting. Check out [here](https://docs.spheron.network/deployments/get-started#configuring-the-deployment).

1. Choose the branch to deploy from the dropdown and provide the root directory if you have a monorepo-like app structure.
2. Set the install command to yarn install
3. Set the build command to yarn build
4. Set the publish directory to dist
5. You can add some environment variables before the build.
6. You can change the node engine of your deployment as well.
7. Click Deploy

## That's All!

Now that you've deployed your Vue.js project on Spheron, you have all the benefits of Spheron — including a custom deployment environment, continuous deployment whenever you push to your repo, and much more — as well as the benefits of Vue.js like Preview Mode, Static site rendering.
After deploying, your new Vue project will automatically be assigned a `.spheron.app` suffixed domain. You can then add a [Custom Domain](https://docs.spheron.network/domain-and-https/centralized-domain/attach-domain) on your choice.
We're so excited to see what you build with Vue.js on Spheron!
