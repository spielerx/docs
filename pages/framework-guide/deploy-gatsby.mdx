# How to Deploy Gatsby Apps on Spheron

This guide will show you how to deploy a Gatsby project and get your domain up.
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is an open-source static site generator built on top of Node.js using React and GraphQL. It provides over 2500 plugins to create static sites based on sources as Markdown documents, MDX, images, and numerous Content Management Systems such as WordPress, Drupal and more.

## Deploy Gatsby to Spheron

Follow these steps to deploy your Gatsby app on Spheron.

### Step 1: Put Your Gatsby Project Code in a Git Repo

While this feature is not new to developers, the magic of Spheron is that every push to any branch in your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo triggers a new build and deployment of your project.

### Step 2: Deploy using the Spheron Platform UI.

You can create a new Spheron project using the platform UI. First, visit [Spheron Network](https://app.spheron.network/) in your browser.
Choose your preferred Git provider from the options as seen above and authorize Spheron to access the repo you want to deploy.\
In the next screen, select your Gatsby repo from the list.
Choose your preferred protocol where you want to deploy your static build. As of now, we support Arweave, Skynet, Filecoin & Pinata. You can choose any one protocol from all 4 of them.
The third screen asks for details about where to create the project and how to build it. All the settings are already pre-filled based on the suggested framework. Learn more about each build setting. Check out [here](https://docs.spheron.network/deployments/get-started#configuring-the-deployment).

1. Choose the branch to deploy from the dropdown and provide the root directory if you have a monorepo-like app structure.
2. Set the install command to yarn install
3. Set the build command to yarn build
4. Set the publish directory to public
5. You can add some environment variables before the build.
6. You can change the node engine of your deployment as well.
7. Click Deploy

## That's All!

Now that you've deployed your Gatsby project on Spheron, you have all the benefits of Spheron — including a custom deployment environment, continuous deployment whenever you push to your repo, and much more — as well as the benefits of Gatsby like Preview Mode, Static site rendering.
After deploying, your new Gatsby project will automatically be assigned a `.spheron.app` suffixed domain. You can then add a [Custom Domain](https://docs.spheron.network/domain-and-https/centralized-domain/attach-domain) on your choice.
We're so excited to see what you build with Gatsby on Spheron!
