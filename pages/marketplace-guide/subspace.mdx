# How to deploy an Subspace Node?

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Subspace, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Subspace node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **Subspace Network** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **us-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Select the "farmer" tab under **Personalize Your Compute Service** section.
8. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
9. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
10. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
11. Add your "wallet address" under Template Configuration.
12. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Create a Sub Wallet

### Install Sub Wallet Chrome Extension

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for "Sub Wallet - Polkadot Wallet Link". Or Download it from [Here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/subwallet-polkadot-wallet/onhogfjeacnfoofkfgppdlbmlmnplgbn).
2. Click "Add to Chrome" and follow the prompts to install the extension.

### Create a Sub Wallet Account

1. Click on the Sub Wallet extension icon in your Chrome browser.
2. On the SubWallet page, Click "Create a new account".
3. Agree to the terms and conditions by clicking the checkbox and then Click "Continue".
4. Create a secure password for your account. Remember to save it securely as SubWallet cannot recover lost passwords. Copy or download the seed phrase provided.
5. Confirm that you have securely stored the seed phrase by clicking "I have kept it somewhere safe."

### Configure Subspace Gemini 3H Network

1. Click on the settings icon located in the upper right corner.
2. Navigate to the **Network** section and enable "Subspace Gemini 3H".

### Copy Wallet Address

1. Return to the main menu of the SubWallet extension.
2. Click "tSSC" and copy the wallet address.

## Verify Installation

- The Subspace Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- The **Instance Logs** of the "Farmer Service" will display the output about the operations performed.
- You can also access the Subspace Plot Manager using the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info for Port 8080** to verify if the plots are being created.
