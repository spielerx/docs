# How to deploy MongoDB?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with MongoDB, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.

To deploy MongoDB follow these steps:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **MongoDB** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click "Change Plan".
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click "Select Plan".
7. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add **Root Username** and **Root Password** for the MongoDB instance.
9. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer to the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **Root Username** - The username used for accessing the MongoDB database.
- **Root Password** - The password associated with the MongoDB database user.

## Verify Installation

MongoDB can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to MongoDB?

You can use the connection string URI to connect to MongoDB.
The standard URI connection scheme has the following format:

```
mongodb://[username:password@]host[:port][/[defaultauthdb][?options]]
```

- `mongodb://` - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
- `username:password` **(optional)** - Authentication credentials passed in App Configuration. If specified, the client will attempt to authenticate the user to the `authSource`.
- `host[:port]` - The host and port number where the mongod instance is running. Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info**.
- `/defaultauthdb` **(optional)** - The authentication database to use if the connection string includes `username:password` authentication credentials, but the **authSource** option is unspecified. If both **authSource** and **defaultauthdb** are unspecified, the client will attempt to authenticate the specified user to the admin database.
- `?options` **(optional)** - A query string that specifies connection specific options as `<name>=<value>` pairs. If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must specify a slash `(/)` between the last host and the question mark `(?)` that begins the string of options.

For more information, refer to the [MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).
