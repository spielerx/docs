# How to deploy an Lava Validator Testnet?

<VideoPlayer embedId="lXZcMKPUgaY" />

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Lava, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Lava validator testnet:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **Lava Validator Testnet** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **us-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
8. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
10. Add your "Moniker" under **Template Configuration**.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Verify Installation

- The Lava Validator Testnet can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. You can refresh the logs by clicking the refresh icon.

### Create or Recover Your Wallet

Go to **Shell Command** from the left navigation and follow these steps:

1. **To create a new wallet**

```sh
lavad keys add wallet
```

2. **To recover an existing wallet**

```sh
lavad keys add wallet --recover
```

Then, enter your mnemonic phrase when prompted.

### Fund Your Wallet

1. Visit the **#faucet** channel on the [official Lava Network Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Tbk5NxTCdA) and request funds by sharing the address you previously created.
2. Check your wallet balance using:

```sh
lavad q bank balances $(lavad keys show wallet -a)
```

Make sure you have at least **100000ulava** tokens.

3. If you don't see a balance, your node might still be syncing with the blockchain. Wait until the **`catching_up`** status is **`false`**.
4. Monitor your wallet on the Lava Explorer: Keep an eye on your transactions and balance by visiting [Lava Explorer](https://lava.explorers.guru/validators) and entering your wallet address. This step is crucial for ensuring that your wallet has been successfully funded and is correctly reflecting the transactions on the blockchain.

### Verify Network Synchronization

Check the synchronization status with:

```sh
lavad status | jq .SyncInfo
```

Proceed when **`catching_up`** turns to **`false`**.

### Register Your Validator

1. Use the following command to create your validator, replacing placeholders with your information:

```sh
lavad tx staking create-validator --amount=90000ulava --pubkey=$(lavad tendermint show-validator) --moniker "YOUR_MONIKER_NAME" --details "YOUR_DETAILS" --website "YOUR_WEBSITE_URL" --chain-id=lava-testnet-2 --commission-rate=0.1 --commission-max-rate=0.2 --commission-max-change-rate=0.05 --min-self-delegation=1 --gas="auto" --gas-adjustment "1.5" --gas-prices="0.05ulava" --from=wallet -y
```

2. Customize the command with your details: <br /> Replace **`YOUR_MONIKER_NAME`**, **`YOUR_DETAILS`**, and **`YOUR_WEBSITE_URL`** with your information.
3. Make sure you see the validator details:

```sh
lavad q staking validator $(lavad keys show wallet --bech val -a)
```

4. Wait a few minutes after executing this command, before checking your node on the [Lava validators list](https://lava.explorers.guru/validators).
